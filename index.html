            Hi everyone, I am Tej Nihal Singh and I am a current student in Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College. Let me take to you to my flashback when I started my journey with web development. I was 6 years old when I first saw one of my seniors doing coding in the computer lab. I was so fascinated with that thing that I copied that whole code on my rough copy, came back home and tried to make it in my computer. That was the moment when I decided that I want to start learning coding. I first learned C, C++, C#, Java. After learning these languages, I started my core coding language due to which I started computers, HTML, CSS, and JS. I gave my full time concentration to coding apart from my studies in school.

        When I started my coding journey, I faced a lot of times when I decided to quit because at one moment it was easy but at the same moment, it seemed to be an impossible task for me. But I pushed myself everytime by looking a very famous quote everytime.<br><q class="quotation">while (!(succeed = try)); <cite>- Anonymous</cite></q>
    </p>

    <p>
        When I was introduced to <abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>, I got confused at every point because it is so <em>complicated</em>, which only looks so due to the fact that JavaScript is always coded with so many lines of code that a lot of things can get messed up. After giving a lot of time<sup>a lot</sup> ,I finally got my command over JavaScript and then started the JavaScript libraries.
